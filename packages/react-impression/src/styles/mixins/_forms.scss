// We highly encourage you to not customize the default value, but instead use
// this to tweak colors on an as-needed basis. This aesthetic change is based on
// WebKit's default styles, but applicable to a wider range of browsers. Its
// usability and accessibility should be taken into account with any change.
//
// Example usage: change the default blue border and shadow to white for better
// contrast against a dark gray background.
